# Covid-19-Case-Prediction-Machine-Learning

This repository includes all current release, development code for Surya Selvam's Pandemic Forecasting Ensemble. The enemble model includes implementations of LSTM (Long Short Term Models), CNN risk categorization algorithms, and statitsical trend-based algorithms. Data for the model is stored in sub-module at [This Link](https://github.com/surya2/Covid-19_Analysis_ML/blob/main/README.md)

# PFE_predictors: A Covid-19 Prediction Modeling Toolkit

This repository contains code for a suite of shallow and long-term Covid-19 case prediction models. The code leverages several libraries including:

* Pandas
* SciPy
* scikit-optimize
* Requests
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Usage

This toolkit can be used to predict future Covid-19 cases based on a variety of factors including:

* Daily Cases
* Daily Deaths
* Rates of Infection
* Vaccination Rates
